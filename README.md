# You-Vs-Monster
Developing a simple game application as a part of learn Vue by doing. I'm using the CDN version of Vue due to the simplicity of this project. This project covers two-way data binding, event handling, methods, data, directives, dynamically handling css classes, conditionals and list rendering concepts in Vue.
